Description: This program imports a .csv file, manipulates the stored database, and then exports the updated
database back into the original .csv file.

Important notes: The data file must be stored in the same file as the python program file. Also on a
minor note, different python engines may have the potential to mess up line spacing.

Limitations: Data file is hardcoded into code. No option to change unless changing actual code.

Instructions: In the Ubuntu terminal window:
		1. Navigate to folder where program and data file stored
		2. Run by typing: python3 CS3130-LabAssignment-1.py
